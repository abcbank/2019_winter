# 4. Interrupt & Exception

## Exception
- any event that disrupts the normal execution of the processor and forces the processor into execution of special instructions in a privileged state
  1. Synchronous Exception(= exception)
     - Raised by internal ev  ents - 내부적(소프트웨어적) 이벤트
     - events **generated by** the execution of **processor instructions**
     - examples
       - alignment exception: 접근할  수 없는 주소에 접근하려고 할때
       - divide-by-zero: 어떤 수를 0으로 나누려고 할때
       - trap instruction / trace exception: system call function, debugging function(중단점) 등등

  2. Asynchronous Exception(= interrupt)
     - raised by external events - 외부적(하드웨어적) 이벤트
     - events **not related by** the execution of **processor instructions**
     - events associated with hardware signals
     - examples
       - pushing reset button - reset exception
       - packet reception
- Exception Handling: the process of responding to the occurrence of exceptions often disrupting the normal flow of program execution

## Interrupt
- an asynchronous exception triggered by an event that an external hardware device generates
- **Interrupts are on class of exception**
- event sources are external hardware

## Applications of Exceptions and Interrupts
1. Internal Error Handling
  - divide-by-zero
  - privileged instruction in user mode
  - floating point instruction w/o FPU

2. Move into privileged mode
  - trap

3. Debugging
   - trace exception

4. Hardware concurrency
   - completion of hardware operation
   - DMA completion

5. Signal of hardware service arrivals
   - packet arrivals

## Programmable Interrupt Controller
- Programmable Interrupt Controller(PIC)
  - Prioritizing multiple interrupt sources
    - that any time the highest priority interrupt is presented to the core CPU for processing
  - Offloading the core CPU with the processing required to determine an interrupt's exact source

- Nested Interrupt
  - a higher priority interrupt source preempts the processing of a lower priority interrupt -> 지원하는 경우도 있고, 안하는 경우도 있다.

- Interrupt Vector
  - The processor automatically fetches the instruction from one of the known addresses based on the interrupt number

## Processing Exception
1. 최소한 현재 진행 상태가 어딘지를 알아야됨(Status Word)
2.
